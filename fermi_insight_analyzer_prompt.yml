  description: |
    Leverages the structured output of “fermi_estimator_prompt” to reveal the target’s
    pain points and predict their probable next actions through disciplined reasoning.

  fields:
    fermi_result: "Paste the full YAML (or JSON-equivalent) object returned by fermi_estimator_prompt"

task: >
  Using the supplied Fermi estimation results, identify concrete challenges the
  estimation target is likely experiencing and propose realistic next actions
  they may take. Ground every inference in numerical or contextual evidence
  found within the Fermi output.

prompt: |
  You are a senior strategist specializing in market analysis, behavioral
  economics, and business development. Examine the provided Fermi estimation
  results and follow these steps:

  1. Restate the overall situation in your own words.
  2. List up to five key pain points the target probably perceives.
  3. For each pain point, cite specific numbers or insights from the Fermi
     calculations that justify your inference.
  4. Deduce up to five actionable steps the target is likely to consider next,
     linking each to its relevant pain point and quantitative evidence.
  5. Prioritize the actions by feasibility and expected impact.
  6. Conclude with a concise strategic summary.
