    title: 'ChatGPT "Deep Research" Knowledge Base'
    version: "1.0.0"
    last_updated: "2025-05-27"
    objective: >
      Give any LLM a single-document reference that exhaustively captures what
      Deep Research is, how it works, how to use it safely, and its current
      feature/plan matrix.
  overview: >
    Deep Research is an agentic mode inside ChatGPT that autonomously plans,
    browses, evaluates and synthesizes online information (text, PDFs, images and
    data files) to deliver a fully-cited research report at analyst level depth,
    typically in 5 – 30 minutes.
  core_capabilities:
    - multi_step_reasoning: >
        Uses an o3-derived browsing-optimized model to iteratively search,
        filter, read, run Python code when needed, and refine its plan.
    - full_source_transparency: >
        Every factual claim is footnoted with live web citations inside the
        final report.
    - file_context_ingestion: >
        Users can attach spreadsheets, slides or PDFs that are treated as first-class
        sources during analysis.
    - clarifying_questions: >
        Before running, Deep Research may ask follow-up questions to tighten scope
        and avoid wasted runtime.
    - asynchronous_execution: >
        Research runs even if the chat window is closed; users receive a
        notification when the report is ready.

  prompting_guidelines:
    principles:
      - "State *why* the research matters and the intended decision."
      - "Specify audience expertise & preferred output style early."
      - "Bound scope with concrete dimensions: geography, timeframe, metrics."
      - "Demand depth: patterns, contradictions, strategic implications."
    recommended_meta_prompt: |
      ## High-Impact Deep Research Request
      *Purpose*: {{goal}}
      *Audience*: {{stakeholder}}
      *Key questions*:
        1. {{question_1}}
        2. {{question_2}}
      *Sources*: prefer peer-reviewed, industry reports, filings.
      *Timeframe*: {{period}}
      *Deliverable*: executive summary + detailed appendix with tables.
  best_practices:
    - "Provide rich context and seed data to shorten clarification loops."
    - "Use bullets or numbered lists in your prompt for easier agent parsing."
    - "For time-sensitive topics, request sources newer than a given date."
  limitations_and_risks:
    - "May hallucinate if domain data is scarce; always verify citations."
    - "Runtime can exceed 30 min on complex queries; no progress mid-run."
    - "Lightweight mode has lower depth once full quota is exhausted."
    - "Security: uploading sensitive internal docs risks data exposure—ensure zero-retention or masking."
  security_recommendations:
    - "Mask or anonymize proprietary data before upload."
    - "Enable activity logging & audit trails for compliance."
    - "Draft internal policy defining acceptable Deep Research use."
